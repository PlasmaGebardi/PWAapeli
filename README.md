# PWAapeli
Repository for PWA which allows you to play simple games against your friends

# Features
Main point of the application is to allow easy matching with your friends via generated codes from the application which the other participants enter into their application.

Games chosen for this applications are based on the fact that I have played countless hours of browser based Java applet games (such as mini golf and snooker) against my friends. Sadly those game sites no longer exist or work properly.

# TODO
Everything! :O

Stage 1:
* Simple PWA as basis
* Rudimentary game as a test
* 1 vs 1 multiplayer connectivity

Stage 2:
* Automatic deployment/integration
* Connect 3rd party game catalog or create more playable games
* Multiplayer against several players
